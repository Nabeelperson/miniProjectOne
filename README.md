## Brian Koh and Nabeel Younis
### Senior Design EC436 Fall 2018

Client:
The basis of the front end was created using Craete React App and is done in Reactjs: 
https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md

The end point on G Cloud where the front end was deployed is:
https://seniordesignminiproject-216618.appspot.com/

To run the client, cd into the client folder. Then run the following in the console. Must have npm installed.
```shell
npm start
```

Server:
This is a basic website that is built using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/)

The basic struture of this webapp is based on the [tutorial](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/tutorial/) from the Flask docs.

This is a basic JSON API service that is meant to work in hand with the javascript client webapp. 


Some notes to remeber:
- remember to run the following
```shell
flask init-db   #only once, unless you want to reset the DB
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_ENV=development
flask run       #must be in the repo directory and not flakr dirctory
```
